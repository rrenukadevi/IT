# Python Project : DETECTION OF DISTRIBUTED DENAIL OF SERVICE (DDOS) ATTACK USING EXPLAINABLE AI 
Welcome to the project  This repository contains the starter and final code for two complete projects that will be covered in a YouTube tutorial series. The tutorial series aims to provide comprehensive knowledge about detect the DDOS attack and guide you through building one exciting projects

Modules :
Generation Phase :
   Capture  input packets or flow-level traffic data to generate traffic profiles .
   Monitor traffic in batches .
   For each batch feature extraction takes place to form a traffic profiles.
Detection Phase :
   The goal of the detection phase is to determine whether DDoS attack is present in traffic 
     profile. 
    K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) and K-dimensional Tree(KD) Algorithm is used to detect    
      the DDoS attack.
Classification Phase : 
   The objective of the classification phase is to differentiate malicious IP addresses from normal ones.
    Grid sorting is used to find the malicious IP addresses.
Explanation and Adaptation Phase : 

  In the explanation phase it produces explanatory information about the DDoS attack , like attack intensity , cause of attack and confidence level of  detection results.

By using Min-Max normalization we can normalize KNN searching space from the trained environment to the new environment according to the traffic distributions of the two networks.

 Users can easily adapt the detection model to different environments using prior knowledge, without the need to retrain the model from scratch.

Conclusion :
the Project Presents DDoS detection approach offers significant advancements in both detection accuracy and adaptability. By leveraging an enhanced KNN algorithm and KD tree, the system achieves high detection rates while minimizing computational complexity.
 
The inclusion of explanatory outputs empowers network administrators with clear insights into detected attacks, facilitating prompt and informed decision-making.

Furthermore, the system's adaptability, through integration with existing rules and dynamic threshold adjustments, ensures robust protection against evolving DDoS threats.Overall![image](https://github.com/rrenukadevi/IT/assets/145702996/b50f1225-4c98-4973-b97e-d4456c3cbc07)
